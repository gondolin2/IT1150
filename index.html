    <h1>Allow Me to Introduce Myself</h1>

    <p>My name is Stephanie Taillard <em>(you can call me Stephanie or Steph)</em>. I've been 
        interested in computers and technology since as young as I can remember.
        I was always going through settings and the control panel intrigued about what could 
        be changed and what everything meant. I was/am often the person that my family
        would ask if they ever had a problem and I enjoyed doing it. 
    </p>

        I have some beginner experience with web development (mostly HTML) from Neopets, Myspace, and
        other miscellaneous things like making my own forums through services like phpBB. I'm looking forward
        to this class filling in my knowledge gaps and giving me more practical skills. I'm especially excited
        to learn Javascript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduating from Tri-C, I would love to eventually get a remote job or even work 
        somewhere like Tri-C. One of my dream goals is to own a home somewhere surrounded by nature 
        and maybe even mountains.
